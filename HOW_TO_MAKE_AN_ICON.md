## Design Tips 🎨

### Colors That Look Good Together:
- **Blue → Purple** (tech and smart vibes!)
- **Teal → Cyan** (fresh and modern!)
- **Purple → Pink** (fun and friendly!)
- **Blue → Green** (calm and helpful!)

### What NOT to Do:
❌ Don't use photos (too detailed, looks messy)
❌ Don't use too many colors (keep it simple!)
❌ Don't add lots of text (people can't read it when small!)
❌ Don't make it too complicated (simple is better!)

### What TO Do:
✅ Use 1-2 bright colors
✅ Make one BIG symbol in the center
✅ Leave some breathing room (don't fill every pixel!)
✅ Make sure it looks good when small
✅ Test it! Shrink it down and see if you can still tell what it is

## Testing Your Icon

1. **Make it small** and see if you can still see it
   - In Canva/Figma, zoom out really far
   - Can you still tell what it is? Good!
   - Is it just a blob? Make it simpler!

2. **Try it on different backgrounds**
   - Light mode (white background)
   - Dark mode (black background)
   - Does it look good on both? Perfect!

---

## How to Add It to Your App

1. **Save your icon** as a PNG file
2. **Open Xcode**
3. **Open your NUPI project**
4. **On the left side, click "Assets.xcassets"**
5. **Click "AppIcon"**
6. **Drag your PNG file** into the "1024" box (the biggest one)
7. **Done!** Xcode makes all the other sizes automatically
